# Model Output Data

**Note Output Data will often be too large to host on Github.** 

To access output data for this model, check the M@TE collection on NCI (http://dx.doi.org/10.25914/yrzp-g882), or refer to this model on the M@TE website (http://mate.science)


## Notes:
The output consists of xdmf and h5 files. There is one xdmf file per time step (every 0.5 Myr) and a set of h5 files that contain the distinct model properties.
